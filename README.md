## Description

The purpose of this project was to clean up the HTML code and make it dryer. By making the code dry, it will enhance user experiences with vision imparement who rely on screen readers to interact with the UI. It will also help those who are reading the code of the webpage to more clearly understand the code. During this project, I learned the importance of using ID and Class selectors and where to use them properly in the code.
